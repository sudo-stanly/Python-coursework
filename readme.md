# Python Coursework
This repository is a collection of everything I’ve worked on while learning Python — both from school assignments and my own self-paced practice. It serves as a record of progress, experiments, and knowledge gained along the way.

## Purpose
- Document my journey of learning Python step by step.  
- Keep track of projects, exercises, and syntax notes.  
- Combine **school-paced learning** (assignments, requirements) with **self-paced exploration** (practice projects, experiments).  
- Build a personal reference I can revisit whenever I need a refresher.  

## Structure
- **projects/** → Larger exercises or assignments that apply multiple concepts.  
- **practice/** → Small files testing loops, conditionals, dictionaries, JSON, etc.  
- **notes/** → Personal documentation of Python syntaxes and concepts I’ve learned.  
- **experiments/** → Scratch code, prototypes, or things I tried just for fun.

This repository is not just about finishing tasks, it’s about documenting growth. Every file, even the broken experiments, is proof of progress.
