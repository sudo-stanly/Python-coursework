# Syntax Notes
This folder is my personal review space for learning Python syntaxes while working on projects.  

## Purpose
- Write down new syntaxes I discover while coding.
- Keep small practice files for testing loops, dictionaries, JSON, etc.
- Build a reference I can come back to later, like my own Python notebook.

## How I Use This Folder
- Each file will focus on one syntax or concept.
- Iâ€™ll add examples that I actually typed and tested, not just copyâ€“pasted from online sources.
- As I move forward in projects, Iâ€™ll update this folder to reflect what Iâ€™ve learned.

ðŸ“Œ **Reminder to myself:**  
This is not about making something perfect â€” itâ€™s about building understanding step by step.
