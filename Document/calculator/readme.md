## Overview
A calculator that evaluates a mathematical operation like pemdas without having to use any match case or
by using nested if statements, by accepting the user's input operation like n + (n * n) the program will
automatically print the evaluation.

## Problem
It is more efficient than having to check for each operation like +,- etc... nested cases of if statements
is much slower compared to this approach.

## Solution
by writing a while loop that accepts the user's operation without having a separate variable declaration for
each number and operator, then written a function with an expression from the parameter and with the provided
allowed characters for the operation and replace method and evaluation of the operation.
