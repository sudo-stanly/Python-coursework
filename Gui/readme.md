# Python GUI Exploration

This repository is where I **experiment with Python GUI**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  
This is **not part of my official course**. I'm not focusing on full-scale GUI development ‚Äî just **exploring and playing around** with how GUIs work in Python.

---

## üìö Purpose
- To get a feel for how Python GUIs work.  
- To experiment with windows, buttons, and layouts.  
- To satisfy my curiosity rather than build production-ready apps.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools
- **Python 3.x**  
- GUI libraries (starting with Tkinter, may try others later).
