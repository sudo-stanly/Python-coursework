# Modules
This folder contains **role testing modules** for the Student Grade Management System project.  

Each file here represents a specific role in the system (e.g., `deans.py`, `instructor.py`) and is used to simulate or test functionality related to that role.  

⚠️ **Note:**  
These modules are **for testing only**. They are not part of the core production logic and may be refactored or removed later.
