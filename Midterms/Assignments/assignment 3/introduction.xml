    * XML stands for eXtensinle Markup Language
    * XML was designed to store and transport data
    * XML was esigned to be both human- and machine readable

    * XML is a software- and hardware-independent tool for storing and transporting data.

    * XML Does Not DO Anything
    * Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything.
    * This note is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:
 -->
 
 <note>
    <to>Tove</to>
    <from>Jani</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>

    *The XML above is quite self-descriptive:

    *    It has sender information
    *    It has receiver information
    *    It has a heading
    *    It has a message body

    *But still, the XML above does not DO anything. XML is just information wrapped in tags.
    *Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store, or display it:

    * The Difference Between XML and HTML

    * XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

        * XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
        * HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
        * XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

<!-- 

    * XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags

    * The XML language has no predefined tags.

    * The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.

    * HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.

    * With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.

    *XML is Extensible

        *Most XML applications will work as expected even if new data is added (or removed).

        *Imagine an application designed to display the original version of note.xml (<to> <from> <heading> <body>).

        *Then imagine a newer version of note.xml with added <date> and <hour> elements, and a removed <heading>.

        *The way XML is constructed, older version of the application can still work:

-->

<note>
  <date>2015-09-01</date>
  <hour>08:30</hour>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>

    * XML Simplifies Things

    * XML simplifies data sharing
    * XML simplifies data transport
    * XML simplifies platform changes
    * XML simplifies data availability

    * Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems (or upgraded systems) is a time-consuming task for web developers. Large amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data is often lost.

    * XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.

    * XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.

    * With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.
