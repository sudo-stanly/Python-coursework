    Raw XML files can be viewed in all major browsers.

    Don't expect XML files to be displayed as HTML pages.

<!-- 
    Look at the XML file above in your browser: note.xml

    Most browsers will display an XML document with color-coded elements.

    Often a plus (+) or minus sign (-) to the left of the elements can be clicked to expand or collapse the element structure.

    To view raw XML source, try to select "View Page Source" or "View Source" from the browser menu.

    Note: In Safari 5 (and earlier), only the element text will be displayed. To view the raw XML, you must right 
    click the page and select "View Source".

 <!-- 
    Viewing an Invalid XML File

    If an erroneous XML file is opened, some browsers will report the error, and some will display it, or display it incorrectly.

    Other XML Examples

    Viewing some XML documents will help you get the XML feeling:

    This is a breakfast food menu from a restaurant, stored as XML.

    An XML CD catalog
    This is a CD collection, stored as XML.

    An XML plant catalog
    This is a plant catalog from a plant shop, stored as XML.

    Why Does XML Display Like This?

    XML documents do not carry information about how to display the data.

    Since XML tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document, browsers do not know if a tag like <table> 
    describes an HTML table or a dining table.

    Without any information about how to display the data, the browsers can just display the XML document as it is.

    Tip: If you want to style an XML document, use XSLT.
