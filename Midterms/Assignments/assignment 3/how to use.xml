XML is used in many aspects of web development.

XML is often used to separate data from presentation.
XML Separates Data from Presentation

XML does not carry any information about how to be displayed.

The same XML data can be used in many different presentation scenarios.

Because of this, with XML, there is a full separation between data and presentation.
XML is Often a Complement to HTML

In many HTML applications, XML is used to store or transport data, while HTML is used to format and display the same data.

 XML Separates Data from HTML

    When displaying data in HTML, you should not have to edit the HTML file when the data changes.

    With XML, the data can be stored in separate XML files.

    With a few lines of JavaScript code, you can read an XML file and update the data content of any HTML page.
