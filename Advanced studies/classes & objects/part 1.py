    * what is OOP?
    - OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming
      python is an object oriented language allowing you to structure your code using classes and objects for better
      organization and reusability.
      
    * Advantages of OOP
      - Provides a clear structure to programs
      - Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
      - Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
      - Allows you to build reusable applications with less code

    Tip: The DRY principle means you should avoid writing the same code more than once. 
         Move repeated code into functions or classes and reuse it.
         
         
    What are classes and objects?
    classes and objects are two core concepts in object oriented programming
    a class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class
    example:
    
    !   CLASS                           OBJECTS
        Fruit                           Apple, Banana, Mango
        Car                             Volco, Audi, Toyota                           

    When you create an object from a class, it inherits all the variables and functions defined inside that class.

    ! almost everything in python is an object, with its properties and methods.
    ! a class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
